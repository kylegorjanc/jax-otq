<p>
The OTQ Project is a joint project of <a href="http://www.saltyrunning.com">Salty Running</a> and <a href="https://vimeo.com/wendycitypro">Wendy City Productions</a>.  I now issue a new commandment: thou shalt do the dance. mister wayne, if you don't want to tell me exactly what you're doing, when i'm asked, i don't have to lie. but don't think of me as an idiot. the man likes to play chess; let's get him some rocks. i don't think they tried to market it to the billionaire, spelunking, base-jumping crowd. let me tell you something my friend. hope is a dangerous thing. hope can drive a man insane. no, this is mount everest. you should flip on the discovery channel from time to time. but i guess you can't now, being dead and all. circumstances have taught me that a man's ethics are the only possessions he will take beyond the grave. cities fall but they are rebuilt. heroes die but they are remembered. i once heard a wise man say there are no perfect men. only perfect intentions. bruce... i'm god. well, what is it today? more spelunking? multiply your anger by about a hundred, kate, that's how much he thinks he loves you.</p>
