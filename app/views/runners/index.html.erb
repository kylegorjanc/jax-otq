<h1>The OTQ Project</h1>

<p>This year at the <a href="http://www.1stplacesports.com/jm.html">Jacksonville Bank Half Marathon</a>, a group of runners who have qualified for the Olympic Trials Marathon with an "A" Standard (2:37:00 or better in a marathon) will be running this half marathon as a precursor to the Olympic Trials Marathon, and several of them have agreed to pace a group of hopefuls to a 1:15:00 or better to qualify for the "B" Standard.  An event like this is unprecedented in the US Marathon athletic field.</p>
