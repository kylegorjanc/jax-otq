# [The JAX OTQ Project](https://lit-lowlands-9777.herokuapp.com/)

Jax OTQ is an information resource that allows runners to learn about Olympic Trials athletes and other athletes attempting an [Olympic Trials](http://www.usatf.org/Events---Calendar/2016/U-S--Olympic-Team-Trials---Marathon/Qualifying-Standards.aspx) qualification.  

## Technologies used:
I had big plans at first, but ultimately decided to keep this a simple Rails app and build from there if I had time.

## My approach:

Because the information about the subject matter (the runners) was the most important part of this project, I introduced that first and ensured complete functionality of CRUD methods before moving on.  Because my comment system and other features hinge on users being able to log in, adding user sign-in features was the next logical step.  

## unsolved problems

I was unfortunately not able to achieve full user functionality, having spent more than two full days on it.  I felt this was the most important part of the project, so continued to work at it.

## unexpected gains
While working on the comment system, I learned a great deal of the information I missed about testing and managed to implement it pretty well.  I also was very confused about the lesson on static pages before I figured them out with this project.  I'm very pleased with the result, but at the same time I wish that I had more app functionality.

###resources: 
* [Trello](https://trello.com/b/m5LgIXoA/otq) was a great planning resource for me.  In particular I like the checklists that you can add to each card.  **My user stories are located here.** They are organized by type via cards on a list of user types, and the stories are checklist items.
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3VZ6OgQmwM&feature=youtu.be - on the advice of a classmate I followed this as my first attempt at user logins, but it led me down a path of many error messages. Thinking it was my own error, I began it again from scratch, only to have the same problems.
* https://www.railstutorial.org/book/  - was crucial in helping me learn about testing and helping me make it to user login functionality.
