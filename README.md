# [The JAX OTQ Project](https://lit-lowlands-9777.herokuapp.com/)

Jax OTQ is an information resource that allows runners to learn about Olympic Trials athletes and other athletes attempting an [Olympic Trials](http://www.usatf.org/Events---Calendar/2016/U-S--Olympic-Team-Trials---Marathon/Qualifying-Standards.aspx) qualification.  

## Technologies used:
I had big plans at first, but ultimately decided to keep this a simple Rails app and build from there if I had time.

## My approach:

Because the information about the subject matter (the runners) was the most important part of this project, I introduced that first and ensured complete functionality of CRUD methods before moving on.  Because my comment system and other features hinge on users being able to log in, adding user sign-in features was the next logical step.  

## unsolved problems

* I was unfortunately not able to achieve all the models I wanted, having spent more than two full days on user/session functionality.  But I felt this was the most important part of the project, and that the other models hinged on it, so continued to work at it.
* I also really wanted to do a little javascript click event project where users can "cheer for" (like/favorite) a runner and little stars would pop up around her photo. 
* I think I can use the Vimeo API so I can pull video directly from my partner (the "Miles & Trials" Documentarist) to a page on the site.  That will be really cool when I get there!

## unexpected gains
* While working on the user/session system, I learned a great deal of the information I missed about testing and managed to implement it pretty well.  I also was very confused about the lesson on static pages before I figured them out with this project.  I'm very pleased with the result, but at the same time I wish that I had more cool features.
* Planning was an amazing process this time around. I feel like I began coding with clear direction and a goal in mind, but could begin at the beginning, so to speak.

###resources: 
* Trello was a great planning resource for me.  In particular I like the checklists that you can add to each card.  **My user stories are located [here](https://trello.com/b/m5LgIXoA/otq).** They are organized by type via cards on a list of user types, and the stories are checklist items.  One thing I had trouble with was populating a backlog.  I tried to keep up with myself, but once I'd get into coding, everything just flowed, so updating boards and lists fell by the wayside.
* [Diagramming](https://trello.com/c/4unPOWy2) by hand
* Sketching a [wire frame](https://trello.com/c/7RlhTs1h) - The rest of the design flowed pretty naturally from this, particularly since each page was embedded in the same layout.
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3VZ6OgQmwM&feature=youtu.be - on the advice of a classmate I followed this as my first attempt at user logins, but it led me down a path of many error messages. Thinking it was my own error, I began it again from scratch, only to have the same problems.
* https://www.railstutorial.org/book/  - was crucial in helping me learn about testing and helping me make it to user login functionality.
* http://guides.rubyonrails.org/ - The rails guides were great when I was trying to figure out forms, combat weird error messages, populate data and about a thousand other things.


## Conclusion:
To be continued! This project is the very nascent version of a site I plan to take live, so I plan to keep working on my unsolved problems.  My sister (the boss) is coming up with feedback already, so I'm sure there will be lots more to do as well!
