# The JAX OTQ Project

Jax OTQ is an information resource that allows runners to learn about Olympic Trials athletes and other athletes attempting an [Olympic Trials](http://www.usatf.org/Events---Calendar/2016/U-S--Olympic-Team-Trials---Marathon/Qualifying-Standards.aspx) qualification.

This year at the [Jacksonville Bank Half Marathon](http://www.1stplacesports.com/jm.html), a group of runners who have qualified for the Olympic Trials Marathon with an "A" Standard (2:37:00 or better in a marathon) will be running this half marathon as a precursor to the Olympic Trials Marathon, and several of them have agreed to pace a group of hopefuls to a 1:15:00 or better to qualify for the "B" Standard.  An event like this is unprecedented in the US Marathon athletic field.  This site's aim is to allow "Average Jane" runners to get involved with the formation of Team USA's marathon team by supporting the development of elite runners and to learn just how similar they are to these women.
